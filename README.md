## Note: This pack is deprecated as of Trails v2.0. 

The functionality in this pack were merged into the Trails core in v2.
If this pack is included in your app config, or is relied upon by any
trailpack in your application, it simply print a warning and exit. In
Trails 3.0 (released in April 2017), this trailpack will be completely removed.

----------

Core Trailpack. This pack is required by all [Trails](http://trailsjs.io)
applications, and is reponsible for validating the API definition (the stuff in
api/), merging environment-specific configuration, binding context on
Controllers, Services, and Policies, and other important and fundamental
things.

In particular, this trailpack includes and configures two very important
things:
- Logging
- Internationalization (i18n)

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save trailpack-core
```

## Usage

### Configuration
The core trailpack should always be loaded in your trailpack config.

```js
// config/main.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  packs: [
    require('trailpack-core')
  ]
}
```

### Logging
This trailpack exposes the configured logger (in `config.log`) on the main `app`
object. See [archetype/config/log.js](https://github.com/trailsjs/trailpack-core/tree/master/archetype/config/log.js)
for an example configuration.

```js
// api/controllers/ExampleController.js
module.exports = class ExampleController extends Controller {

  /**
   * Logs the querystring
   */
  exampleHandler (req, res) {
    this.log.debug(req.query)
  }
}
```

### Internationalization
This trailpack also exposes the i18next translator function on the main `app`
object as `app.__` and `app.t`. See [archetype/config/i18n.js](https://github.com/trailsjs/trailpack-core/tree/master/archetype/config)
for an example configuration.

```js
// config/locales/en.json
{
  "helloworld": "Hello World"
}
```

```js
// api/controllers/ExampleController.js
module.exports = class ExampleController extends Controller {

  /**
   * Returns the string "Hello World" if locale is set to "en"
   */
  exampleHandler (req, res) {
    this.app.t('helloworld')
  }
}
```
